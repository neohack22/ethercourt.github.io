 *  Arbitrable abstract contract.

 *  -Define the action taken when a ruling is received by the contract. We should do so in executeRuling.
 *  -Allow dispute creation. For this a function must:
 *      -Call arbitrator.createDispute.value(_fee)(_choices,_extraData);
 *      -Create the event Dispute(_arbitrator,_disputeID,_rulingOptions);
